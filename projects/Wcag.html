                        <p >This project involves evaluating a live website, <strong>BBC News</strong>, against 
                            the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.
                            The evaluation assesses the website's accessibility based on 
                            key principles such as perceivability, operability, understandability, 
                            and robustness. Areas where the website does not meet these principles 
                            are identified, with detailed explanations and actionable recommendations 
                            provided for improvement. The project offers practical experience in 
                            applying accessibility standards and proposing solutions to enhance 
                            inclusive web design.

                        <p >
                            The BBC News website is the famous and trustworthy British news media 
                            that spreads new knowledge, policies, and practices for a global audience, 
                            and builds a platform where individuals have discussions and anlysis on social issues. 
                            The key feature of the BBC website is its comprehensive and diverse coverage across 
                            various sectors, including business, technology, health, global news, and politics. 
                            It also enhances the user experience through interactive multimedia, such as images, 
                            photographs, videos, and audio, which help to present information in an engaging way.

                        <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i>What is WCAG?</h2>
                        <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of recommendations developed 
                            by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure that web content is accessible to all 
                            users, including those with disabilities. WCAG provides a framework for designing and 
                            developing websites that can be easily navigated and interacted with by people with various 
                            impairments, such as visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. The guidelines are 
                            organized into four key principles: <strong>Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR).</strong> 
                            These principles aim to make content more accessible through practices such as providing 
                            text alternatives for non-text content, ensuring navigation is possible via a keyboard, and 
                            making content adaptable to different devices. WCAG also includes success criteria at varying 
                            levels of conformance (A, AA, AAA), allowing websites to be evaluated and improved based on 
                            their accessibility standards. By following WCAG, developers can create more inclusive, 
                            user-friendly web experiences.

                            <h3>Perceivability</h3>
                            <h4>Issue 1: Inconsistent Subtitle Availability for Video Content</h4>
                            <p>Based on WCAG Guideline 1.2: Time-based Media, video or audio content 
                                should include captions or provide alternative formats, such as transcripts or subtitles, 
                                to ensure accessibility. These alternatives aim to make time-based media content perceivable 
                                to users with disabilities, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as 
                                individuals who may not be able to view or hear the media due to situational limitations.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Recommendations</h5>
                            <p>While some videos on the BBC website include subtitle functionality, others lack this essential 
                                feature. To align with WCAG Guideline 1.2: Time-based Media, all video content should consistently 
                                provide accurate and synchronized captions. Additionally, transcripts should be made available 
                                for all pre-recorded audio or video content to cater to users who prefer or require text-based 
                                alternatives. For live video content, the BBC should implement real-time captioning to support 
                                accessibility for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. These improvements will ensure that 
                                all users, regardless of their abilities, can access and understand the content, promoting 
                                inclusivity and compliance with accessibility standards. </p>

                            <p>WCAG Guideline 1.1 focuses on ensuring that all non-text content is 
                                accompanied by a text alternative. This guideline ensures accessibility 
                                for individuals with visual impairments or other disabilities by providing 
                                descriptive text that conveys the purpose or function of non-text elements, 
                                such as images, icons, or charts. The goal is to make all content perceivable 
                                to assistive technologies like screen readers, enhancing the overall inclusivity 
                                of digital platforms.</p>
                            <h5>Recommendations</h5>
                            <p>Some images on the BBC website lack descriptions, which poses significant accessibility 
                                barriers for users who rely on assistive technologies. To address this issue, 
                                it is recommended to add appropriate <code>role</code> and <code>aria-label</code> attributes to these image 
                                elements. The <code>role</code> attribute specifies the purpose or functionality of the image, 
                                while the <code>aria-label</code> attribute provides a concise description that is accessible to screen readers.

                            <h3>Operability</h3>
                            <p> Operability ensures that once users can perceive the content of 
                                a website, they must be able to interact with it effectively. 
                                This principle is supported by four key guidelines: 1. 
                                Allow all tasks to be performed using a keyboard, not just a mouse. 
                                2.Provide users with enough time to complete tasks. 
                                3.Avoid flashing or flickering content that could trigger seizures. 
                                4.Enable users to easily navigate, find content, and understand their 
                                current location within the site. 
                            </p>
                            <h4>Issue 3: Keyboard Access</h4>
                            <p>The issue with the <strong> advertisement and hamburger menu </strong>not being accessible 
                                initially via the Tab key presents a significant barrier to users relying 
                                on keyboard navigation. Users are forced to either repeatedly attempt to 
                                access these elements or resort to using a mouse to trigger them, which 
                                creates an inconsistency in navigation and accessibility. This problem 
                                violates WCAG's Operability principle, particularly the guideline that 
                                requires all interactive elements to be operable by keyboard alone. 
                                For individuals with motor impairments, those who cannot use a mouse, or 
                                users who prefer keyboard navigation, the inability to access these 
                                essential features with the Tab key limits their ability to interact 
                                with the content and navigate the website efficiently.</p>

                                To ensure accessibility, it's important to correctly use the <code>tabindex</code>
                                attribute to ensure that interactive elements, like the hamburger menu 
                                and advertisements, are included in the natural tab order of the page. 
                                By explicitly defining the tabindex for these elements, users can navigate 
                                to them in a logical sequence using the Tab key. Additionally, to support dynamic 
                                elements such as the hamburger menu, JavaScript can be used to ensure they 
                                are accessible immediately after the page loads, rather than requiring specific 
                                user actions to trigger them.

                                WCAG's Understandability principle focuses on making content clear 
                                and easy to comprehend for all users, including those with cognitive, 
                                learning, or language challenges. The guidelines under this principle encourage 
                                clear language, consistent structure, and predictable behavior to ensure that 
                                users can follow and interpret information without confusion. This includes using 
                                simple, concise text, providing mechanisms for users to control content, and offering 
                                alternative ways to present content.

                            <h4>Issue 4: Title Readability</h4>
                            <p>The title of “Maui emergency chief quits amid wildfire criticism” 
                                receives low readability scores from two readability analysis tools,  
                                readabilityformulas.com and charactercalculator. They indicate the texts 
                                are too professional to easily understand. However, the title of 
                                “Drone attack hits building in central Mascow” is moderately easy 
                                to read by individuals with a 7th to 8th-grade reading level.

                                To improve readability, it is crucial to use straightforward 
                                and simple words. For example, the incomprehensible headline 
                                “Maui emergency chief quits amid wildfire criticism” could be 
                                rephrased as “Maui chief quits for fatal wildfire” to better 
                                accommodate a broader audience.

                            <p>“Robustness" focuses on ensuring that web content is compatible with a 
                                wide range of current and future browsers, web-enabled devices, and 
                                assistive technologies. The goal is for the content to display and 
                                function as the author intended, regardless of the platform or technology 
                                being used. A robust web page should adapt to various environments and remain 
                                accessible as technologies evolve. Although browsers and assistive technologies 
                                try to compensate for coding errors, there are limits to what can be corrected.

                            <p> By using IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker, 
                                it was identified that the social media buttons on the website contain <code>data-testid</code>attributes, but they 
                                lack descriptive labels for screen readers. Without proper labeling, screen readers 
                                may fail to communicate the button's purpose (e.g., "Facebook," "Instagram," etc.) to users, , violating the WCAG 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value guideline. </p>
                            <h5>Recommendations</h5>
                            <p>Add descriptive <code>aria-label</code> attributes to each button, so users with screen readers

                        <p>Working on the WCAG accessibility project has been a valuable 
                            learning experience, providing deep insights into the importance 
                            of web accessibility for diverse user groups. Through this project, 
                            I gained a solid understanding of how to assess and apply the Web 
                            Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure that websites are 
                            usable by people with various disabilities, including those who rely 
                            on assistive technologies. I learned to identify common accessibility 
                            issues such as poor keyboard navigation, missing ARIA labels, and 
                            insufficient focus indicators. This experience reinforced 
                            the importance of inclusive design and how making small 
                            adjustments can significantly improve the user experience for 
                            everyone, not just those with disabilities.
