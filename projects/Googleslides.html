                            <p>This method encourages users to verbalize their thoughts as they interact with the user interface, providing valuable 
                                insights into their thought processes and challenges. In the testing, users were tasked with setting transitions for three slides, 
                                allowing evaluators to observe their actions, and any confusion or difficulties that arose during the process. 
                                By verbalizing their actions, users reveal how they interpret the interface, highlighting areas that may need improvement for a 
                                smoother user experience. This real-time feedback is crucial for identifying usability issues and refining the design.

                                                For example, Google Slides helps users avoid content loss during connectivity issues by automatically saving 
                                                files locally. When reconnected, changes are synced to Google Drive, preventing outdated uploads. 
                                                The offline status indicator also reminds users their work is temporarily saved on their device.

                                    Inconsistent labeling can lead to user confusion. 
                                    Users may struggle to differentiate between "Motion," "Transition," and 
                                    "Animation" as each option opens the same right panel with all three features. 
                                    While this inconsistency doesn’t impact functionality, it slightly detracts from the interface‘s clarity.

                                                due to its unconventional layout. To increase the transition speed, 
                                                users drag the slider to the right, which displays lower values—counterintuitive

                                                To improve the usability, it is recommended to implement either a dropdown menu

                            <p>Participants completed individual think-aloud usability tests to avoid bias. Before testing, the setup was prepared, including the computer and Google Slides. Evaluators introduced themselves and outlined the session agenda:

                            <ul>

                                <h4>Variety of Process to Task Completion</h4>
                                <p> Apparently, the different workflow results demonstrate the users' varying mental models. Moreover, since the transition function is displayed in multiple positions in the Google Slides platform, users can access it through different entrances that form various routes. Therefore, users can choose the entry point aligning with their preference to access the transition function.  
                                </p>

                                <h4>Confusion and Difficulty in Using the Transition Slider Bar</h4>
                                <p> The process of adjusting the duration of transitions was not straightforward, leading to frustration and errors. Users often needed to try several times to get used to its interaction. One potential solution could be to replace the transition slider bar with a dropdown menu or plus and minus buttons, 
                                    which are the suggestion presented in the section describing violations.

                                <h4>Doubtful Feeling and Uncertainty about the Motion Panel</h4>
                                <p> The participant who clicked the “Play” button to preview the slide wasn't sure if the action had taken effect. 
                                    Additionally, the interview revealed that the participant ignored the motion icon for a slide with applied transition 
                                    on the slide navigation panel. The uncertainty and confusion suggest that the feedback for when a transition is applied may 
                                    not be clear to users. One improvement can be to rename the “Play” button to “Preview,” indicating the successful setting the implication 
                                    which users can check the slide's status before finalizing their presentation. This minor change in naming could enhance user understanding with the feature.

                                    Moreover, the participant's question “Is that all done?” was raised with doubtful tone after finishing to create the final transition effect and its duration. The uncertain attitude indicates the feedback for motion effects is needed, or users would not know if their actions have been successfully completed. Therefore, providing clear visual feedback is crucial to help users understand the outcome and a slide’s status.
                                    
                                </p>

                                <h4>Feature Functionality Connection to PowerPoints</h4>
                                <p> This observation from the interview conducted after the think-aloud testing suggests that users expected the 
                                    interaction to be similar to their prior experience with Microsoft PowerPoints, especially when they found that 
                                    first and final slides couldn't show the transition effects. This connection suggests that users have 
                                    the expectation of similar functionality between Google Slides and PowerPoints

                            Nielsen's 10 Heuristics help identify key usability issues in user interface design. 
                            This evaluation highlighted problems such as inconsistent feature naming, increased cognitive 
                            load due to unclear display status, lack of feedback on transition effects, and an unintuitive 
                            slider for setting transition duration. These issues point to potential usability challenges, 
                            emphasizing the need for design improvements. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            User-based evaluations, like Think-aloud, provide valuable insights into both user interface 
                            and overall user experience. A key takeaway was that participants overlooked the motion icon on the navigation panel, 
                            despite it aligning with the heuristic of system status visibility. This shows that users may not always notice intended feedback, 
                            stressing the need for clearer design cues. Additionally, participants expressed frustration with the transition duration slider, 
                            which violated the heuristic of flexibility and efficiency of use. 
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While expert evaluations can identify issues early in development, 
                            user-based evaluations reveal how individual backgrounds, technical skills, and prior experiences shape users' mental models. Combining both evaluation methods provides a more holistic understanding of usability, leading to more effective and user-friendly design solutions.
